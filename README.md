# Fire vs Ice (火対氷)
### [Play it here!](http://christiancashiola.me/fire-vs-ice/)
## Background
Fire vs Ice e is a retro-styled 2-player action game inspired by the _1983 Bomberman_. The object is the game is to detroy the other player using fire or ice bombs. Blowing up breakable walls sometimes releases power ups or a trap. There is a shield power up (which grants the player an extra hit-point), an attack power up (which increasing attack range), and spikes (which you want to avoid). Beware, it is very possible for player to destroy him/herself!

## Technologies
This project will be utilize the following technologies: 
+ `Javascript` for game logic
+ `HTML Canvas` for graphics rendering
+ `Webbpack` to bundle JS files
+ Custom artwork (heavily influenced by _Bomberman_)

_In most cases I chose `for` loops over `forEach` loops for optimization_
