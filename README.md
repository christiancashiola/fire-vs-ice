## Background
A responsive single or two-player retro-styled action game inspired by the _1983 Bomberman_. This project was built entirely with vanilla Javascript. (No libraries)

## Technologies
This project will be utilize the following technologies: 
+ `Javascript` for game logic
+ `HTML Canvas` for graphics rendering
+ `CSS` for styling and media queries
+ `Webbpack` to bundle JS files
+ Custom artwork (heavily influenced by _Bomberman_)

_In most cases I chose `for` loops over `forEach` loops for optimization_
